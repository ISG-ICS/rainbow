# Rainbow: Rendering-Aware Index for Big Scatterplot Workload. 

This repository hosts the source code of the paper `Rainbow` submitted to EuroVis 2022.

We provide a [Tutorial](https://github.com/ISG-ICS/rainbow/wiki) to run Rainbow on top of PostgreSQL to visualize 100k synthetic sample tweets data.

Rainbow is a general framework that computes high-quality scatterplots for given result-size budgets. It uses an in-memory rendering-aware index to answer arbitrary zoom/pan queries. 

The following demo video shows the effect of using Rainbow to visualize 10 million tweets on a MacBook Pro laptop.
